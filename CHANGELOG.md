## Development History

This project followed a structured 20-commit development approach:

1. **Commits 1-7:** Foundation (docs, CI/CD, core tests, contracts, backend, indexer)
2. **Commits 8-12:** Advanced Features (seat API, hooks, optimistic UI, events, network UX)  
3. **Commits 13-15:** Quality Assurance (offline support, E2E tests, security audit)
4. **Commits 16-20:** Production Readiness (observability, Docker, deployment, performance, release)

Each commit was designed to be atomic and add significant value to the overall system architecture.
